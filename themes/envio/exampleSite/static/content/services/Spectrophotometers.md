* The Lovibond® COD Setups allow highly sensitive and precise water testing with minimum effort. They measure the ST-COD concentration by photometric detection employing a linear relationship between absorbance and concentration.
After adding the sample to a Lovibond® COD tube test (LR, MR according to ISO 15705:2002), it is heated in the reactor for two hours at 150 °C and then analysed in the photometer.
The COD Setups comprise the photometer, 25 tube tests for each of the two lower measuring ranges, a reactor for sample digestion and a vial stand.

* Waste Water Set-Ups: MD 600, MD 610, SpectroDirect
