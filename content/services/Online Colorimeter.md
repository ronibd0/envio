* Model: TA 4 Online-System
* Continuous, Online Colour Measurement for Precise Process Control

* This generation of online colorimeters measures a near real-time response across the spectrum (380 to 780 nm) or less. This spectrophotometric approach allows for the use of internationally recognised colour coordinate systems, such as CIELAB and CIE xzY with the subsequent translation of colour data to industry specific colour scales, as referenced by standardising bodies such as AOCS, DGF, ISO and ASTM.
